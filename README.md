## Description

https://openweathermap.org/api
The dashboard will take the user city search, convert city name to latitude and longitude coordinates to then use in the api call. This will return weather for the current day, and the next 5 days with information including: 
  - temperature
  - wind speed
  - humidity
  - description
  - icon
  - date

For easy access to recent searches, there is a search history element added to the page.
